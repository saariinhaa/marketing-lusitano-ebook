\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 A visually striking eBook cover titled "Marketing Lusitano: Conquista Digital". Blend traditional Portuguese elements like blue-and-white azulejos tiles, Manueline architectural patterns, and maritime motifs (e.g., compass roses, ships) with subtle digital themes like glowing data lines, pixelated textures, digital grids, and futuristic light overlays. The design should balance heritage and innovation \'97 old Portuguese art meets digital marketing. The color palette should feature classic Portuguese blues and whites, with hints of digital neon (light blue or green). Add a subtle emblem or crest that suggests conquest or leadership. The composition should feel elegant, slightly vintage, but infused with modern tech-inspired accents. }
